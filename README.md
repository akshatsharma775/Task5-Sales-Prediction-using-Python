# OIBSIP Task5-Sales-Prediction-using-Python

Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts future sales based on historical data and other relevant features. Accurate sales predictions are crucial for businesses to manage inventory, optimize supply chains, and plan marketing strategies. This project leverages Python, along with data science and machine learning techniques, to build a robust model for forecasting sales across different products, regions, and time periods.

Problem Statement

Sales prediction is a vital task for businesses to anticipate demand and optimize operations. By analyzing historical sales data and incorporating factors such as pricing, promotions, seasonality, and external influences, this project seeks to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict future sales. The goal is to help businesses make informed decisions that improve resource allocation, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.

Objectives

    .Data Preparation: Collect and preprocess historical sales data, including product details, sales figures, pricing, and external factors.
    .Feature Engineering: Identify and create features that significantly impact sales, such as moving averages, promotional periods, and seasonal indicators.
    .Model Development: Train and evaluate various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict sales.
    .Model Optimization: Fine-tune the model to improve prediction accuracy, focusing on minimizing errors and handling different types of products or regions.
    .Deployment: Develop a system that can be integrated into real-time applications for continuous sales forecasting.
